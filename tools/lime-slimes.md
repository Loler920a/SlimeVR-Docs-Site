# L,i,me by Loler920a
(*At time of writing*) L,i,me is a case and hardware variant of the standard slime aimed to natively support a full **9** IMU setup (with an optional addon (**WIP)** to allow 4 more IMU's) while being as streamlined as possible with no degredation to performance


# Who is this for?
- L,i,me is for those who wish to streamline their current standard slime setup by easily converting into a L,i,me
- For those who want to make a full no compromise 9 IMU setup from the start (With the option to add an extra 4 more IMU's for shoulder and elbow tracking)
- People on a tight budget but want a performant full 9 IMU setup (with the option to add shoulder and elbow tracking in the future)
- Those who intend to use slimevr for mocap and vtubing

# Why choose L,i,me?

- Unlike **standard slimes** that can only support **2 IMU's**. Each main **L,i,me** supports **4 IMU's** (without any software modification). 
- Meaning you only need to make 3 L,i,me units instead of 6 standard slimes for a full 9 IMU setup
- As a result there are less parts
- Making L,i,me the cheapest full 9 IMU setup (As well as 13 IMU setup with optional addon)
- No compromises to performance due to hardware layout
- Aimed at providing the best stable tracking with comfort and full maneuverability due to being less bulky overall (Less main units)
- Only need to charge and maintain 3 units (4 if you include the optional addon)
- Modular and customisable
- Ongoing support
- Future octoslime support (Double battery life)
# Doing more with less
- Less units
- Less parts
- Less costs
- Less building
- Less maintaining
- Less units to charge
- More SLIME!

# FAQ

- **Can I use this with other standard slime trackers?**

Yes, yes you can

- **This is my first time soldering or doing DIY with electronics, is this ok for me to build?**

If you have confidence that you can or learn to splice cables cables together, then you should be good. 
Thats probably the hardest thing in a standard slime build as well, though you will be doing it more with L,i,me.

- **Can I convert my standard slimes into L,i,me's**

Yes, in fact I converted my previous slimes into this. Though you may want to change the battery and switch

- **I don't have enough IMU's can I add them later?**

Yes you can in fact start off at minimum 6 IMU's and addon the other IMU's later. Please be sure to plan ahead

- **When will the elbow and shoulder tracking addon be available?**

When I finish testing and can confirm there are no issues

- **When will the Neck tracking addon be available?**

When I get to it

- **Can I lie down, roll or whatever on the tracker and its extensions?**

Sure go ahead, you will find nothing will prevent you from doing so

- **The IMU I want to use is not listed what do I do?**

You can contact me on the slimevr discord and ask me to model the 3D files for you

- **I have an issue**

You can ask on the slimevr discord for help or from me if you like

- **Where is the L,i,me software?**

There is none, L,i,me is exclusively a hardware solution and will work seemlessly with slime

- **What are the octoslime files?**

WIP models to support octoslime. These are currently only for show, although are technically usable
